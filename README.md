# Heart Disease Analysis

This project is the first bit of work I did with a Kaggle dataset. 

The dataset associated with this analysis is the very popular Heart Disease UCI dataset. It is commonly used when first working with classification problems and proved to be a great learning experience for myself. 

The fundamental take away from the project was working towards obtaining accurate predictions of whether someone had heart disease based on a variety of health related variables. This then stemmed into understanding the magintude of the influence of individual variables on the predicted outcome. 

It was eye-opening to experience working with some of the analytical tools which are available especially after the model has been built. I have also learned a thing or two about heart disease which I had no previous exposure to. It's incredible to see the vast learning potential when applying familiar techiniques to datasets which are very unfamiliar at first.
